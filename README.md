# Kotlin
> Kotlin is a free, open-source cross-platform general purpose programming language. It provides object oriented and functional programming features. Its focused-on interoperability, safety, clarity and tooling support. Kotlin was named after an Island, just like Java. The island is in the Gulf of Finland near St. Petersburg.

# Gameplay
> A more adavnced version of Tic-Tac-Toe.    
> Instead of 3 same moves from a player, it requires 4.  
> Moreover, the board is bigger as well.  
> The game Connect-Four is an 8x8 board displaying a grid where players take turns placing an item piece on any location of the 2D matrix to get either 4 in a row, 4 in a column or 4 diagonally. Time ‘t’ is designated as five seconds by default to allow the AI opponent to decide on a next move via the search algorithm known as Alpha-Beta Pruning. Alpha-Beta pruning will be the algorithm used to find the best move along the game tree using the adversarial search minimax algorithm to efficiently prune moves that do not need to be evaluated any further down the depth of the tree’s branch.

# Rule  
> Connect 4 moves to win the game (in row, column, or diagonal).  
> Block opponent's moves to prevent them from winning.
